version of the Software as of the time we make such version available to you under this 
Agreement.  We may release future versions of the Software under this Agreement or a 
different agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement is a commitment to you of 
compatibility between the Software and any future versions of the Software. This 
Agreement shall apply to any such updated Software made available to you except as 
otherwise expressly agreed in connection with such updated Software.

version of the Software previously provided to you under this Agreement or a 
predecessor agreement, you may not loan, rent, lease or otherwise transfer the original

hereto, not from any rights to ownership of tangible media, which if provided is only 
provided for your convenience.

a period of not less than one year from initial release of the Major Release.

iii.	Problem and Error Resolution.  We will investigate all potential errors related to 
the Software's nonconformance to any documentation we provide, so long as 
you have notified us in writing (including via email and via submission to a 
support site or portal we make available to you) during the License Term.  We 
will make commercially reasonable attempts to substantiate the existence of 
the problem or error, evaluate the seriousness of the problem's effect on you

the Error Reporting and Priority Guidelines.  This does not guarantee that the 
resolution will include an update to the Software that will resolve or fix the 
reported issue.

            commands is inoperable; or the use is otherwise significantly impacted; 
            licensing issues not related to the deployment of the user's product.

            does not provide a function in the most convenient or expeditious manner 
            or produces incorrect results, and the user suffers little or no significant 
            impact.

            documentation changes.

be incorporated by you into products over which we have no control, provided to Customers we

and not we, therefore, have essential control over circumstances that will enable you to assess 
and mitigate risk associated with the use of the Software.  The provisions of this Agreement are 
designed to allocate risk consistent with these realities.  You accordingly acknowledge that you 
understand that an essential purpose of the exclusion of warranties, the indemnification and 
limitation of liability provided in this Agreement is allocation of risks between both of us, which 
allocation of risks is reflected in the applicable fees and other arrangements between both of us 
in the Agreement, and that we would not be willing to enter into this Agreement with you and 
license the Software to you if we were required to bear any additional risk.
